### Automated Tests with .NET
<p>This repository presents an <b>automated testing project</b> using the .NET platform. To implement the tests, the xUnit library was selected, one of the most robust and popular for the .NET ecosystem.</p>
<p>The focus of this project is the "Jornada Milhas" application, a travel offers platform.</p>
<p>Here, you will find the testing framework, practical examples and the configuration necessary to run and validate the application's automated tests.</p>

##
### Features
- [x] Create automated tests using the XUnit library
- [x] Write unit tests to ensure code quality
- [x] Apply the AAA standard to write tests with more clarity and organization

##
### Observations:
<p>The purpose of the <b>Assert</b> is to ensure that the behavior of the tested code aligns with the expected outcomes, providing immediate feedback.</p>
<p>There is a testing pattern called the <b>AAA (triple A)</b> pattern, which consists of:</p>
<ul>
<li>Arrange (Scenario)</li>
<li>Act (Action)</li>
<li>Assert (Validation)</li>
</ul>
<p>There is also the <b>Given-When-Then pattern</b>, which is similar but more behavior-oriented than structurally oriented like the AAA pattern.</p>
